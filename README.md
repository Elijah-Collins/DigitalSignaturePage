    <h2>What is a Digital Signature?</h2>
    <p>A digital signature is a way or scheme to find out the authenticity of a digital messages, information and documents. It can guarantee the contents of a message, which may or may not have altered with. You may also add a hash to view the message contents using either a public or private pair key.</p>
    <h2>Who started this?</h2>
    <p>In 1977, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman invented the digital signature.</p>
    <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
    <p>Digital signatures can work like ‘electronic fingerprints’ of sorts. It can take the form of a coded message, and securely associates a singer with a document in an electronic transaction. There are both Digital and Electronic Signatures, there are some similarities, and some differences. In short, some named differences could be found in implementation, geographical use, and legal/cultural acceptances. Digital Signatures are often used to solve issues with tampering and/or impersonation of someone in digital communications.</p>
    <h2>Four facts</h2>
    <p>- In 1988, Lotus Notes was the first to have marketed the idea.   - User Signatures cannot be replicated without the use of the original private key.   - Use and Idea of digital signatures grew with the need to have a faster, more secure way to authenticate documents and other items that couldn’t be forged.   - Digital Signatures are used for the sole purpose of making sure that any document or item is used or forged without your say so or own hands.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Alice writes Message > Message is Hashed > Hash becomes Encrypted w/ Private Key > Message and Hash are both sent over via Internet > Hash is Decrypted with Alice’s Public Key > Compared with message and is checked for any Tampering.</p>
    <h2>How does this effect coding?</h2>
    <p>Digital signing effects coding because you can see who sent you what or who sent you the code. You can also see if someone has tampered/worked on your code.</p>
